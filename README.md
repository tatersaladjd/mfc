# README BEFORE USING ANY OF THIS CODE

First, if you're here and reading this, you're a member of github, or are clever enough to know how to grab a repository without being a member. Congratulations on choosing an awesome source control (among other things) provider.

Second, I do not *officially* provide support for the code located here. This stuff is only for my attempt at reworking my MFC profile. If, however, you find value in what I've done and want to reuse it, feel free. Additionally, if you find a bug, or make an enhancement, submit a pull request through github. As time permits I'll evaluate those and possibly, maybe, accept them.

Third, The content outside of the *vendor* folder is licensed under the MIT license per MIT-LICENSE.md
Check the vendor specific libraries for their license before using them.

Finally, I reserve the right to nuke this repository at any time. So... remember... if you're not cloning it, you've been warned. It might go away... Then again. It might not.
